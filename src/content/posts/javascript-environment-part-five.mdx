This is part five of a six part series I've written to assist in my learning, and also to help anyone else out there facing similar struggles.

## Closures

In this part I'll be discussing a special topic: closures. I'll explain what they really are in the context of everything I've covered so far in this series,
and then I'll show their two most common use cases.

First, it's review time again. We know that every time a function is defined, it creates a new lexical environment. 
We also know that every lexical environment keeps a reference to the environment it was created in. 

Alright now here's the new part:

In other words, every time a function is invoked it has access to all identifiers in scope at the time of its definition&mdash;
*even if it is invoked after the scope in which it was defined is no longer on the call stack.* 

This results in what is known as a closure. 
The variables in scope when the function was defined are *enclosed* around that function, such that they can be accessed at a later time.

### Using Closures with Callbacks

Callback functions are functions that are called after some asynchronous operation has completed, 
at which point the execution context and lexical environment they were defined in will no longer be on the call stack. 

Because the callback function creates a closure when it is defined, it's still possible to access variables defined outside its lexical environment. 

```
var tick = 0;
var timer = setInterval(function(){
  if(tick < 8){
    console.log(tick);
  }
  tick++;
}, 1000)
```

In this example, `tick` is still in scope despite the callback function being the only function on the call stack. 

### Using Closures to Create Private Variables

Every time a constructor is invoked using the `new` keyword, a new lexical environment is assigned to it to track variables local to the constructor. 
Because of this, we can declare variables inside the constructor that are only accessible in the scope of the constructor. Private variables in JavaScript! 

Functions defined as methods have access to the scope in which they were defined, 
which creates a closure around those variables. Because of this, these methods can be used to mutate the private variables associated with a particular object.

Again, these variables cannot be accessed directly because they are not connected to the context of newly initiated objects; they can only be accessed through the closure. 

```
function Counter(){
  var count = 0;
  this.getCount = function(){
    return count;
  }
  this.increment = function(){
    count++;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Counter()` constructor has a private variable `count` only available in its scope. 
This variable cannot be accessed directly; it must be accessed through the two methods provided in the constructor. 

Note though, because these private variables rely on closures, it is possible to access them through other objects by accident. Be careful!

```
var counterA = new Counter();
var counterB = {};
counterB.getCount = counterA.getCount;
console.log(counterB.getCount()) // logs the count of counterA
```

In this example, `counterB` has access to the count of `counterA` because it is given a reference to the `getCount()` method, 
which has access to the `count` variable through the closure.

See, you were probably already using closures all the time and you didn't even realize it!
