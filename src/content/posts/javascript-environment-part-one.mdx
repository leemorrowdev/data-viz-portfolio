This is part one of a six part series I've written to assist in my learning, and also to help anyone else out there facing similar struggles. 
Check out the other parts of this series:

When I first started learning JavaScript from nothing last year, I often found myself frustrated, 
struggling to comprehend concepts that just didn't make sense on their own. 
One moment I would read that JavaScript is single threaded, the next I'd find myself learning about asynchronous code, callbacks, promises, and async and await.

The more I studied, the more seemingly contradictory or just downright confusing concepts I discovered.

After all this frustration, I finally decided to learn how JavaScript works to get to the bottom of it.

## Engines

To understand JavaScript, you have to have a broad understanding of its environment. JavaScript environments are made up of two main components:
- a JavaScript engine
- a platform engine

### JavaScript Engines

JavaScript engines manage the execution of JavaScript code on the application's main thread. 
All JavaScript engines implement the features required by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) [ECMA-262 standards](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm), 
or ECMAScript. These standards are written by the ECMA's Technical Committee 39, or TC39. TC39 produces new standards annually in July. 

**Note:** A scripting language is a programming language designed to work with a specific run-time environment. 
In this case, ECMAScript is the standard used for web scripting languages, and JavaScript is merely the most popular implementation of that standard. 

### Platform Engines

Okay so just to prevent any confusion, as far as I'm aware I'm the only one using the term platform engine. Most of the time you'll see the term browser engine because most JavaScript environments are in browsers.
But what about Node and React Native, both of which have their own engines? Thats where platform engine comes from. Its just a more general term.

Anyways, platform engines manage how JavaScript applications interact with the device they are running on by providing applications with built in APIs to access device hardware or run libraries built into the environment itself.

In browsers these APIs are known as Web APIs, and are standardized by the [HTML5 standards](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/). 
Most other browser engine implementation details are not standardized, and are either similar purely by convention, or unique to the platform.

Non-browser platform engines do not follow the HTML standards. They often support some browser APIs like `fetch` and timers, but the exact APIs they implement is entirely dependent on the platform.

## Operations

It turns out there is a good reason for JavaScript environments to contain two different engines. 
It's because there are two types of operations that all JavaScript environments must support:
- Synchronous operations
- Asynchronous operations

### Synchronous Operations

Synchronous operations are run one at a time by the JavaScript engine on the single main thread of an application.

JavaScript environments follow this single threaded execution model to prevent *race conditions*. 
- Race condition: when generating the correct output of an operation is dependent on the sequence of two or more other operations whose sequence cannot be guaranteed.

**Examples:** 
- Main application logic
- Changes to the UI

### Asynchronous Operations

Asynchronous operations are not run by the JavaScript engine; they are run by the platform engine on an entirely different thread.
These operations run by being called by JavaScript functions, even though their actual logic is built into the platform engine in its native language. 
In the case of browser engines, these are the Web APIs I mentioned earlier, which are written in C++.

Without asynchronous operations, long running tasks normally handled by APIs would have to run on the main thread in the JavaScript engine. 
But there is only one main thread that executes tasks one at a time, so this would constantly block the UI from re-rendering!

**Examples:**
- Timers
- Server operations

## Whats Next?

In the next two parts of this series I will go into detail about the design of each engine. 
Then, I'll discuss the two phases in JavaScript executed and some particularly challenging problems that arise from this.
Finally, I'll explore two special topics that were particularly confusing to me before I learned about how JavaScript works: asynchronous code and closures.
