## JavaScript Execution

In this part I'll explain the two phases of JavaScript execution:
1. The Identifier Resolution Phase
2. The Execution Phase

I'll also discuss some important concepts related to this model.

### Execution Phases

#### The Identifier Resolution Phase

Remember, identifier resolution is the process of mapping (registering) identifiers (variable or function names) to variables (memory locations). 
In JavaScript, this process occurs every time a new lexical environment is created. 

Here's an outline of the identifier resolution phase for a single lexical environment:

1. Create the Lexical Environment
2. If the environment is a function or global environment:
   - Scan the environment for function declarations:
     - Register the identifiers of function declarations that are outside other functions, and define their corresponding functions
     - If an identifier already exists in the outer environment, overwrite it
3. Scan the environment for variable declarations:
   - If the environment is a block environment:
     - Register identifiers of variables declared with `let` and `const` in the current block, but do not initialize them
       - If an identifier already exists in the outer environment, overwrite it
   - If the environment is a function or global environment:
     - Register the identifiers of variables declared with `var` outside other functions, and initialize them as `undefined`
       - If an identifier already exists in the current environment, overwrite it
     - Register the identifiers of variables declared with `let` and `const` outside blocks, but do not initialize them
       - If an identifier already exists in the current environment, throw a `SyntaxError`, as variables declared with `let` and `const` cannot be re-declared

##### Variable Declarations

If you follow the outline above, you'll see why `const` `let` and `var` work the way they do!

- `const`: 
  - cannot be re-declared
  - cannot be reassigned
  - can be modified
  - must be initialized on definition
  - block, loop, function, or global scope
- `let`: 
  - cannot be re-declared
  - can be reassigned
  - can be modified
  - block, loop, function, or global scope
- `var`: 
  - can be re-declared
  - can be reassigned
  - can be modified
  - function or global scope

##### A Note on "Undeclared Variables"

From time to time I became confused when I found references to "Undeclared Variables" on Stack Overflow. 
People call them undeclared because it looks like they were never registered with any variable declaration:

`foo = null`

But thats actually not whats happening at all! These variables are being created as properties of the global object, which is defined by the global Environmental Record.

#### The Execution Phase

Once the identifier resolution phase is complete, the execution phase begins and JavaScript code is executed line by line.

### Important Concepts

##### Hoisting

So the identified resolution phase registers variables and function declarations before the execution phase. Whats the big deal? 
Actually, this simple concept causes some very unexpected results. 

Any time you've heard someone mentioned *hoisting*, 
this is what they're talking about! People say this because in JavaScript, variables declared with `var` and function declarations can be accessed before their declarations. 
It's as if they are being *hoisted* to the top of the environment. And to add to the confusion, variables declared with `let` or `const` cannot be accessed. 
Trying to do so results in a `Reference Error`! This is why you sometimes see people saying that variables declared with `let` and `const` are not hoisted.

So what causes these two different behaviors?

Well, variables delcared with `var` are initialized as `undefined` on their registration and function declarations are defined on registration.

```
console.log(foo); // logs the function
console.log(bar); // logs undefined

function foo() {};
var bar = null;
```

In this example, both `foo` and `bar` can be accessed before their declaration. 

Unlike variables declared with `var`, variables declared with `let` and `const` are never initialized as `undefined` on registration; 
they are left uninitialized until the execution phase. When accessed early, they throw a `Reference Error`.

```
console.log(foo); // throws a reference error
console.log(bar); // throws a reference error

const foo = null;
let bar = null;
```

Why the sudden inconsistency??

ECMAScript standards explicitly state [let and const](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/#sec-let-and-const-declarations) 
"may not be accessed in any way until the variable's LexicalBinding is evaluated."

This restriction results in a zone between the declaration of variables declared with `let` or `const`
 and the top of the environment which is known as the *Temporal Dead Zone* (TDZ). 

The TDZ exists to ensure variables declared with `const` cannot be mutated as variables declared with `var` can, 
because this would violate their entire purpose. Variables declared with `let` only have the TDZ for consistency, since both are block scoped.

Feel free to go back and reference the outline of the identifier resolution phase from earlier, or just test any of this in a console if you don't believe me.

##### Overriding Function Declarations

Alright so this is another really strange one. You're probably going to need the outline to follow along.

Variables declared with `var` are only initialized as `undefined` in step three of the identifier resolution process if they have not been encountered in the environment. 
If a variable is declared with `var` but has the same identifier as a function declaration, 
the variable will already have been encountered because function declarations are registered before variables in step two of the identifier resolution process. 
As a result, the variable will not be initialized as undefined; instead, it will retain its value, the function, until the variable is re-initialized. 

```
console.log(foo); // logs the function
var foo = null;
function foo(){}
console.log(foo); // logs null
```

In this example, the identifier `foo` is registered and assigned a reference to a function declaration in step two of the identifier resolution process. 
In step three, it is not set to undefined because the identifier `foo` already exists in the environment; 
instead, it is left with the function `foo` assigned as its reference until it is re-initialized by the var declaration. 
This reassignment causes the function declaration's reference to be lost, and thus overridden. 

This same behavior can be accomplished by simply re-initializing `foo`:

```
console.log(foo); // logs the function
foo = null;
function foo(){}
console.log(foo); // logs null
```

But not by re-declaring `foo`: 

```
console.log(foo); // logs the function
var foo;
function foo(){}
console.log(foo); // logs the function
```

Because the identifier `foo` is never re-initialized, it retains its reference to the function declaration and is not overridden. 

Function declarations can only be overridden with `var` or by simply re-initializing the identifier. 
Using `let` or `const` will result in a `SyntaxError` because `let` and `const` cannot be re-declared from any other variable. 

No wonder some people hate JavaScript. 
But hey, not to worry, now you'll never be confused about this again because I'm sure you've memorized the outline of the identifier resolution phase by now.

##### Is JavaScript Compiled or Interpreted?

JavaScript is an interpreted language. ...Or at very least it's definitely not a compiled language in the traditional sense.

Many interpreters use hybrid optimization techniques like Just In Time (JIT) Compilation.
But this does not change the simple fact that JavaScript engines must have two distinct consecutive execution phases, 
preventing JavaScript code from being compiled into a single binary file.
