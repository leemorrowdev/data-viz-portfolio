This is part two of a six part series I've written to assist in my learning, and also to help anyone else out there facing similar struggles.

## JavaScript Engines

In this part I will go through the main components in JavaScript engines: 
- The heap, or global memory
- Lexical environments
- Execution contexts
- The execution context stack, or call stack
- The macrotask and microtask queues

### The Heap

The heap contains references to all function declarations and variables. It is more commonly referred to as global memory. 

### Lexical Environments

[Lexical environments](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/#sec-lexical-environments) are basically JavaScript's internal implementation of scopes. 
They are each associated with a syntactic structure, for example a function declaration or a block statement, and are used for *identifier resolution* in that structure.
- Identifier resultion: the process of mapping (registering) identifiers (variable or function names) to variables (memory locations).

It's worth noting that there are three additional lexical environments subclasses that provide support for environments that require unique attributes or additional functionality:
- **global environments:** Sets the outer lexical environment's reference to `null`
- **function environments:** Provides `this` binding and provides support for `super` invocations
- **module environments:** Provides bindings for the top level declarations and imports in modules

Each lexical environment contains:
- An internal `[[Environmental Record]]` property that records all identifier bindings in the environment. 
- A reference to the Environmental Record of the current environment's outer environment.

**Note:** Double bracket notation is used to refer to an internal property that cannot be accessed.

Environmental Records are necessary because the JavaScript engine must be able to access identifiers declared outside the current environment during identifier resolution. 
If an identifier is not found in the current environment, the outer environment must be searched through the current environment's internal reference to it. 

There are two primary Environmental Record types:
- **declarative Environmental Records:** Used to bind identifiers of variables and functions
- **object Environmental Records:** Used to bind identifiers of object properties

There are also three Environmental Record subtypes used in the subclasses I mentioned earlier.
- **global Environmental Records:** Provides binding for built-in globals, properties of the global object, and all top-level declarations
- **function Environmental Records:** A subclass of declarative Environmental Records that provides `this` binding and contains the state used for `super` invocations
- **module Environmental Records:** A subclass of declarative Environmental Records that provides bindings for the top level declarations and imports in modules

### Execution Contexts

[Execution contexts](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/#sec-execution-contexts) are used with the execution context stack to track the application's execution.
The execution context stack is more commonly referred to as the call stack, 
but I'm being technical here so I'm going to continue calling it the execution context stack for this series.

Even in ES2015, there are two base types of JavaScript code: 
- global code
- function code

There also two types of execution contexts:
- global execution context: The execution context for all global code. There is only one global execution context in each JavaScript program. 
- function execution context: The execution contexts created in the global execution context on each function invocation. 

Execution contexts are also used in identifier resolution, because each execution context contains two associated lexical environments:
- LexicalEnvironment: contains all identifier bindings for function declarations, `let`, and `const`
- VariableEnvironment: contains all identifier bindings for `var`

**Note:** This is why people sometimes say the `this` keyword represents the environment's `context`.

### The Execution Context Stack

Once again, this is more commonly referred to as the call stack. I'm just being technical. So if it easier for you to follow along, 
just replace execution context stack with call stack in your mind.

When a function is invoked, the current execution context must be stopped and a new execution context must be created. 
Once this execution context has completed, it is discarded and the original execution context resumes where it left off. 
The [execution context stack](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/#execution-context-stack) 
tracks these execution contexts to ensure application execution pauses and resumes correctly when functions are invoked or return. 

### The Macrotask and Microtask Queues

The components of JavaScript engines I've covered so far only account for synchronous behavior, 
but asynchronous operations return callback functions with their own function execution contexts. 
JavaScript engines must maintain the order these callbacks arrive so that they can eventually be added to the execution context stack. 

To handle this, JavaScript engines must maintain two task queues:

- **Macrotasks:** Used for executing large tasks like global JavaScript code, as well as low priority asynchronous operations like IO events and some API callbacks
  - examples: `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`

- **Microtasks:** Used for executing smaller tasks that update the application state like callbacks in promises. Microtasks execute as soon as possible, 
before the UI re-renders
  - examples: Promise callbacks

**Note:** In the ECMAScript standards these queues are referred to has the 
[ScriptJobs and PromiseJobs](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-jobs-and-job-queues) queues.
